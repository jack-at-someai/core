## Charlotte Thesis for All State

**"Nobody at the fixture/furniture layer has a data strategy."**

The technology platforms (365, Nayax, Cantaloupe) own transaction and inventory data. The operators own customer relationships. The fixture manufacturers are "dumb" — they ship metal and that's it.

A Charlotte substrate that gives All State visibility into installation patterns, operator needs, product configuration trends, and market dynamics would be a genuine competitive advantage in a space where nobody else is thinking this way.

The fixture layer is becoming technology-adjacent. Fixtures now need to accommodate cameras, sensors, screens, and wiring. The companies that integrate digitally — with fixture configurators, operator dashboards, and predictive ordering — will own the next 50 years.

Charlotte doesn't replace what All State does. Charlotte makes what All State does **observable, measurable, and predictable**.
