**1.3 "Signal History"** means the append-only record of all observations, measurements, and events ingested into the Client's Substrate over time, across all Sites.

## 2. SCOPE OF SERVICES

**2.1 Service Model.** This is a managed service engagement covering multiple Sites under a unified Substrate. The Provider deploys, operates, and maintains the Substrate on behalf of the Client. The Client does not access, configure, or operate the Substrate directly. The Client receives Deliverables — not platform access.

**2.2 Phase 1 — Foundation (Months 1–6).** During the Foundation Phase, the Provider will deploy:

- (a) **Brand identity and design system** — Comprehensive visual identity consolidation, style guide, and digital design system ensuring consistency across all 12+ locations and digital channels
- (b) **Custom e-commerce platform** — Replacement or augmentation of the Client's existing Shopify-based site with a purpose-built, search-optimized platform featuring real-time inventory visibility across all Sites, structured product catalog with market pricing data, and collector account infrastructure
- (c) **Collector CRM** — Unified customer graph spanning all Sites. Every collector modeled as a NODE with cross-location purchase history, preferences, lifetime value, grading submission history, and event attendance
- (d) **Domain discovery and operational walkthrough** — On-site visits to the Client's Boston headquarters and a minimum of three (3) additional Sites to document retail operations, inventory management, grading workflows, live break production, and team structures
- (e) **Knowledge graph seeding** — Initial Substrate deployment with entity nodes (cards, collectors, locations, employees, competitors, grading companies, vendors), relationship edges, and historical data import from existing POS and Shopify systems
- (f) **Grading pipeline tracker** — SIGNAL stream tracking every grading submission from intake through submission to PSA/BGS/SGC, status updates, return, and sale or vault
- (g) **Competitive intelligence baseline** — Initial mapping of the Client's competitive landscape within the $33B sports collectibles market, including Fanatics Collect, Whatnot, Goldin, Arena Club, Heritage Auctions, and independent retailers
- (h) **Product catalog digitization** — Complete structured inventory of card products, memorabilia, TCG, and entertainment collectibles across all Sites with market pricing hooks

**2.3 Phase 2 — Operations (Months 7–24).** Following the Foundation Phase, the Provider will expand to:

- (a) **Multi-location inventory intelligence** — Real-time METRIC system tracking inventory across all Sites. What's where, what's moving, what's stale, what needs restocking. Cross-location transfer recommendations based on local demand signals
- (b) **Live break analytics** — Unified analytics across CardVault Breaks, Fanatics Live, eBay Live, and WhatNot. Viewership, conversion rates, revenue per break, attribution to in-store visits, and optimal scheduling intelligence
- (c) **Cross-store collector graph** — Full relationship intelligence: which collectors shop at multiple locations, purchase patterns, category preferences, grading submission behavior, event attendance, and predicted lifetime value
- (d) **Market pricing feed** — Real-time connection to eBay completed sales, 130point data, and Card Ladder pricing. Every card in inventory mapped to current market value. Price trend alerts for high-value holdings
- (e) **Location performance dashboard** — Cross-site operational intelligence: revenue per location, foot traffic, conversion rate, average basket size, top-selling categories, and location-vs-location benchmarking
- (f) **Weekly analytics delivery** — Per-site and aggregate operational intelligence reports covering sales pipeline, inventory health, collector activity, grading pipeline status, and market trends
- (g) **Protocol management** — Authentication verification workflows, grading submission protocols, inventory intake procedures, store opening playbooks, live break production checklists, and buy/sell/trade evaluation frameworks
- (h) **Drift alerts** — Notification when monitored metrics deviate from expected trajectories across any Site: revenue decline, inventory imbalance, grading pipeline delays, collector churn signals, or competitive market shifts
- (i) **Monthly strategic review** — Cross-site operational review with the Client's leadership team, including trend analysis, expansion modeling, and strategic recommendations
- (j) **Expansion intelligence** — Data-driven site selection support for new locations based on collector density, venue traffic, competitive presence, and demographic alignment
