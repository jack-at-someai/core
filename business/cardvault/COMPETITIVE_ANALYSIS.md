## Revenue Estimation

CardVault is privately held with no public revenue disclosures. The following estimation uses industry benchmarks and available signals:

### Method 1: Per-Location Revenue
- Premium sports card shops at high-traffic venues typically generate **$2M–$5M/yr** per location
- CardVault has 12 locations at marquee venues (TD Garden, Wrigley Field, SoHo, Mall of America)
- Mix of flagships (higher volume) and standard locations
- Conservative estimate: 12 locations × $2.5M avg = **$30M**
- Aggressive estimate: 12 locations × $4M avg = **$48M**

### Method 2: Inc. Growth Rate
- Inc. Magazine reported 338% growth over 3 years
- If Year 1 revenue was ~$5M (3 locations): $5M × 4.38 = **~$22M**
- If Year 1 revenue was ~$8M (premium venues): $8M × 4.38 = **~$35M**

### Method 3: Employee Count
- Estimated 100–200 employees across 12 retail locations + corporate
- Revenue per employee in specialty retail: $150K–$300K
- 150 employees × $200K = **$30M**

### Method 4: E-Commerce + Live Breaks
- Shopify store adds 15–25% to brick-and-mortar revenue
- Live breaks (WhatNot, Fanatics Live, eBay Live) add another 10–20%
- Base retail $30M + e-commerce $6M + breaks $4M = **$40M**

### Consolidated Estimate

| Scenario | Annual Revenue | Basis |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Conservative | $25M | 12 locations at $2M avg |
| Base Case | $35M | Per-location + growth rate convergence |
| Aggressive | $50M | Premium venues + e-commerce + breaks |

**Working estimate: $30M–$40M annual revenue** with rapid growth trajectory. The company is pre-profit given aggressive expansion (9 stores opened in <12 months), but revenue velocity is high.

## Charlotte Thesis for CardVault

**"CardVault is the only national retail chain in a $33B market — and they have zero unified data infrastructure across 12 locations."**

The grading companies own authentication data. The marketplaces own transaction data. The card manufacturers own product data. The retail layer — where CardVault lives — is flying blind on:

- **Which collectors shop at multiple locations?** (No cross-store CRM)
- **What's the grading submission pipeline?** (Cards go out, come back weeks later — no tracking)
- **Which products move at which venues?** (Wrigley vs SoHo vs Mall of America have different demographics)
- **What's the real-time market price of in-store inventory?** (No connection to eBay sold data)
- **How do live breaks convert to in-store visits?** (No attribution)

Charlotte makes every card a NODE, every collector a NODE, every transaction a SIGNAL, every grading submission a tracked PROTOCOL, every location a measurable METRIC source. The same infrastructure powering industrial equipment service and swine genetics — deployed to the fastest-growing sports collectibles retailer in America.

12 locations generating independent data streams today. Charlotte stitches them into a single observable graph. That's the pitch.
