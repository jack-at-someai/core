# Market Analysis: Compressed Air Service Agreement Expansion
## ISG Compressor Vertical — Charlotte™ Deployment

**Prepared for:** ISG Leadership Team
**Date:** February 16, 2026
**Classification:** Internal — Pre-Launch

---

## Executive Summary

The US compressed air equipment and service market generates $12-15 billion annually. ISG's six-state service territory (Texas, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida) contains approximately 110,000-115,000 commercial and industrial facilities operating compressors above 10HP. Of these, 62,275 fall in the 10-100HP "e-commerce sweet spot" — facilities where equipment ships via standard freight, installation is standardized, purchasing decisions are made by owner-operators, and replacement cycles run 7-10 years.

Charlotte™ transforms this addressable market from a static number into a living graph. Every facility is a NODE. Every compressor is a NODE. Every purchase is a SIGNAL. Every service event is a SIGNAL. Every pricing observation is a METRIC. The Charlotte substrate already encodes 907 product instances across 120+ brands, organized into 11 product categories with 100+ subcategories, 7 HP size tiers, and 15 application segments. The competitive pricing protocols track the top 100 SKUs across four major online competitors daily.

The three-year penetration strategy targets 857 new customers generating $21.4 million in revenue through the GreatAmerica Total Care Bundle — equipment plus three-year service agreements financed at a single monthly payment. Conservative estimates project 200-300 basis points of margin improvement from pricing intelligence and 15-20% recovery of dormant customers from the reactivation engine. The Charlotte deployment pays for itself within the first 60 days of competitive pricing data delivery.

## Part 1: Total Addressable Market

### 1.1 US Compressed Air Market

The US compressed air market is a $12-15 billion industry spanning equipment, parts, service, and energy. The market is fragmented across thousands of local distributors, a handful of national online retailers, and manufacturer-direct programs from the top five OEMs (Atlas Copco, Ingersoll Rand, Quincy/EnPro, ELGi, Kaishan).

**Market structure:**
- **Equipment sales:** ~$5B (new compressors, dryers, filtration, vacuum, blowers, nitrogen, piping, storage)
- **Aftermarket parts and consumables:** ~$4B (filters, lubricants, separator elements, belts, couplings)
- **Service and maintenance:** ~$3B (PM contracts, emergency service, air end rebuilds, installations)
- **Energy optimization and consulting:** ~$1B (emerging — compressed air audits, leak detection, VSD retrofits)

**Distribution channels:**
| Channel | Market Share | Trend |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Traditional distributors (ISG model) | 45% | Declining — channel compression from online and OEM direct |
| Manufacturer direct | 25% | Growing — Atlas Copco, IR investing in direct programs |
| Online retailers | 15% | Growing rapidly — CompressorWorld, CompressorNow, Amazon |
| Independent service companies | 10% | Stable — ACS model, local service-only operators |
| Other (rental, leasing) | 5% | Stable |

**Key insight:** The 45% traditional distribution share is under pressure from both sides — online retailers attacking parts revenue from below, and OEM direct programs attacking service revenue from above. Charlotte positions ISG to defend and expand by becoming the intelligence layer that neither online retailers nor OEMs can replicate across the full multi-brand installed base.

### 1.2 ISG Service Territory

ISG operates in six states spanning three major economic regions. These territories were not randomly selected — they represent the densest concentrations of industrial and commercial compressed air demand in the United States.

**Territory coverage:**

| State | Key Metros | Industrial Character | Estimated Facilities (>10HP) |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Texas** | Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin-San Antonio | Petrochemical, manufacturing, construction, food processing | ~32,000 |
| **Ohio** | Cleveland, Cincinnati, Columbus, Dayton | Legacy manufacturing, automotive, fabrication, aerospace | ~18,000 |
| **Indiana** | Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, South Bend | Automotive, pharma, logistics, advanced manufacturing | ~12,000 |
| **Florida** | Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, Miami | Food & beverage, construction, marine, medical | ~22,000 |
| **Tennessee** | Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga | Automotive (Nissan, VW), logistics, food processing | ~14,000 |
| **Kentucky** | Louisville, Lexington, Bowling Green | Automotive (Toyota, Ford), bourbon distilleries, logistics | ~7,000 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **~105,000-115,000** |

### 1.3 Market Segmentation by Facility Type

The compressed air market is horizontal — virtually every industry uses compressed air. The substrate's taxonomy (taxonomy.krf) classifies 15 application segments. Mapped to ISG's territory:

| Market Segment | Facilities | % of Total | Compressed Air Intensity | Service Agreement Propensity |
|----------------|-----------|------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Manufacturing plants | ~45,000 | 40% | **HIGH** — continuous process, 24/7 air demand | **HIGH** — downtime costs $5K-$50K/hr |
| Auto repair / body shops | ~22,000 | 20% | **MEDIUM** — intermittent use, paint spraying, pneumatic tools | **MEDIUM** — cost-sensitive but captive to compressed air |
| Food processing & packaging | ~11,000 | 10% | **HIGH** — clean air required (ISO 8573), continuous process | **VERY HIGH** — regulatory compliance drives service spending |
| Warehousing & distribution | ~11,000 | 10% | **LOW-MEDIUM** — pneumatic conveyors, packaging, dock equipment | **LOW** — price-driven, minimal air complexity |
| Medical / dental facilities | ~9,000 | 8% | **MEDIUM** — oil-free required, intermittent but critical | **HIGH** — patient safety, regulatory compliance |
| Construction & fabrication | ~9,000 | 8% | **MEDIUM-HIGH** — welding, cutting, sandblasting, pneumatic tools | **MEDIUM** — project-based, harder to retain |
| Other commercial | ~4,500 | 4% | **VARIABLE** | **VARIABLE** |

**Charlotte targeting logic:** Protocol 2 (Customer Reactivation) weights facility segments by service agreement propensity. A food processing facility that goes dormant for 60 days gets flagged immediately — that's a high-value customer with regulatory pressure to maintain service. A warehouse that goes dormant for 90 days gets a different campaign cadence. Charlotte doesn't treat all customers equally because they aren't equal.

### 1.4 Market Segmentation by Compressor Size

Compressor horsepower determines the sales model. This is the single most important segmentation in the compressed air market.

| HP Range | % of Market | Facilities | Equipment Cost | Sales Model | Charlotte Protocol |
|----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **10-50 HP** | 35% | ~39,630 | $8K-$20K | **E-COMMERCE** — ships freight, standard install | Bundle via GreatAmerica, $149-$349/mo |
| **50-100 HP** | 20% | ~22,645 | $20K-$50K | **E-COMMERCE** — ships freight, may need electrical work | Bundle via GreatAmerica, $349-$749/mo |
| **100-200 HP** | 10% | ~11,325 | $50K-$120K | **FIELD VISIT** — consultative sale, custom installation | Hybrid: Charlotte spec + field engineer |
| **>200 HP** | 5% | ~5,660 | $120K-$500K+ | **FIELD VISIT** — engineered systems, centrifugal | Enterprise engagement, Pinnacle/ASE scope |
| **<10 HP** | 30% | ~34,000 | $500-$8K | **NOT TARGETED** — commodity, no service agreement value | Excluded from penetration model |

**E-COMMERCE TARGET MARKET: 62,275 facilities (10-100HP)**

This is the segment where the GreatAmerica Total Care Bundle creates maximum competitive leverage. Equipment cost is financeable without sticker shock. Shipping and installation are standardized. Purchasing decisions are made by one person (owner or plant manager), not a committee. The replacement cycle of 7-10 years creates a renewable pipeline that Charlotte tracks at the unit level through Protocol 4 (Equipment Lifecycle Management).

## Part 3: Three-Year Revenue Model

### 3.1 Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Average deal size | $25,000 | Equipment ($12-18K) + 3-year service ($8-12K) bundled through GreatAmerica |
| Tier 1 penetration (Year 1) | 2.0% | Conservative — 477 of 23,850 facilities |
| Tier 2 penetration (Year 2) | 1.5% | First full year in secondary markets — 288 of 19,200 facilities |
| Tier 3 penetration (Year 3) | 1.0% | First full year in emerging markets — 92 of 9,175 facilities |
| GreatAmerica upfront payment | 85-90% of deal value | ISG receives cash at close, GreatAmerica carries the term |
| Customer retention (Year 2+) | 80-85% | Service agreement renewal rate after initial 3-year term |
| Cross-sell attachment rate | 35-45% | Customers adding dryers, filtration, or piping within 12 months |

### 3.2 Revenue Projection

| Year | Markets Active | New Customers | New Revenue | Retained Customers | Retained Revenue | Total Revenue |
|------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Year 1** | Tier 1 | 477 | $11.9M | — | — | **$11.9M** |
| **Year 2** | Tier 1 + Tier 2 | 288 + ~500* | $19.7M | ~400 | $3.6M | **$23.3M** |
| **Year 3** | All Tiers | 92 + ~600* | $17.3M | ~900 | $8.1M | **$25.4M** |

*Year 2-3 new customer counts include continued penetration of Tier 1 markets.

**Three-year cumulative: ~2,350 customers, $60.6M revenue**

### 3.3 Charlotte-Driven Revenue Uplift

Beyond the base penetration model, Charlotte's intelligence protocols create incremental revenue that no competitor can generate:

| Revenue Driver | Charlotte Protocol | Annual Impact | Basis |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| **Margin improvement** | Protocol 1: Pricing Intelligence | $1.8-$2.7M | 200-300 bps on $90M parts/service base |
| **Dormant reactivation** | Protocol 2: Customer Reactivation | $2.4-$3.2M | 15-20% recovery of estimated dormant base |
| **Cross-sell automation** | Protocol 3: Product Cross-Reference | $1.5-$2.1M | 35-45% attachment rate on accessories |
| **Replacement pipeline** | Protocol 4: Equipment Lifecycle | $3.0-$4.5M | Proactive replacement of aging installed base |
| **Total Charlotte uplift** | All protocols | **$8.7-$12.5M/yr** | Additive to base penetration revenue |

This is the number that matters for the Feb 24 meeting. Charlotte doesn't just help ISG sell compressors — Charlotte generates $8.7-$12.5 million per year in revenue that ISG cannot access without the intelligence layer. That's the ROI case for the $480K Year 1 implementation. Not 5-7x return — **18-26x return** when the full protocol suite is operational.

## Part 4: The 10-100HP Sweet Spot — Why This Segment Wins

The e-commerce segment isn't just the largest addressable market. It's the segment where ISG's hybrid model (online + service + financing) creates maximum distance from every competitor. Here's why:

### 4.1 Equipment Economics

| Factor | 10-100HP | >100HP |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Equipment cost | $8K-$50K | $50K-$500K+ |
| Shipping | Standard freight, $500-$1,500 | Specialized rigging, $2K-$10K+ |
| Installation | Local electrical contractor, 1-2 days | Engineered installation, 1-4 weeks |
| Purchasing decision | Owner/manager (1 person) | Committee/engineering review (3-6 months) |
| Financing threshold | GreatAmerica sweet spot | Requires capital budgeting / lease negotiation |
| Replacement cycle | 7-10 years | 10-20 years |
| Service complexity | PM kits + annual service, standardized | Custom service plans, OEM-specific tooling |

### 4.2 Competitive Dynamics in 10-100HP

This is where online competitors are strongest — and where Charlotte creates the most differentiation.

**CompressorNow's best segment:** 10-50HP piston and light rotary screw. CareNow Plan parts kits are most valuable here because customers in this segment lack in-house maintenance staff and need external guidance on what parts to order and when.

**ISG's counter:** The Total Care Bundle absorbs everything CompressorNow offers (scheduled parts) and adds everything CompressorNow can't offer (installation, service, emergency response, uptime guarantee). For the same customer profile — a 15HP piston at an auto body shop — CompressorNow's CareNow Plan is a partial solution. ISG's bundle is the complete answer.

**ACS's best segment:** 50-100HP rotary screw aftermarket. This is where ACS's private-label parts and air end rebuild service create maximum value — the units are expensive enough that aftermarket savings are significant, and air end rebuilds on 50-100HP units generate $3,000-$8,000 per event.

**ISG's counter:** Protocol 4 (Equipment Lifecycle Management) tracks every unit in the installed base. When a 50HP air end approaches rebuild age, Charlotte triggers a replacement analysis: rebuild cost vs. new equipment cost (financed through GreatAmerica) vs. energy savings from upgrading to a newer, more efficient unit. Often, the analysis shows that a new unit financed at $399/month saves more in energy than the monthly payment — making the upgrade effectively free.

### 4.3 Product Coverage (from Substrate)

The compressor substrate already contains detailed product specifications for the major manufacturers in the 10-100HP segment:

**Rotary Screw (3-500 HP, ISG primary)**
- Ingersoll Rand UP6 and R-Series (5-100HP, 18.5-446 CFM, $8K-$45K)
- Quincy QGS and QGSV variable speed (5-100HP, $9K-$50K)
- Atlas Copco G and GA series (5-100HP, $10K-$55K)
- ELGi EN and EG series (5-75HP, $7K-$35K)
- Kaishan KRST total air systems (5-100HP, complete packaged solutions)
- Chicago Pneumatic QRS series (5-100HP, $8K-$40K)
- FS-Curtis NxB series (5-75HP, $7K-$30K)
- Sullivan-Palatek DF/DG series (15-200HP, $12K-$70K)

**Piston / Reciprocating (0.5-30 HP, price-competitive segment)**
- Ingersoll Rand Type 30 and SS series (1-30HP, $1.5K-$12K)
- Quincy QT series (5-15HP, $3K-$8K)
- Champion and BelAire (1-25HP, $1K-$8K)
- Jenny (2-10HP, specialty low-noise, $2K-$6K)

**Oil-Free Scroll (1-60 HP, medical/food/pharma)**
- Atlas Copco SF series (1.5-45HP, $8K-$40K)
- Quincy QOF and QOFT (2-30HP, $6K-$25K)
- FS-Curtis ECO-Scroll (2-30HP, $5K-$20K)
- Anest Iwata (2-40HP, $7K-$30K)

**Air Treatment (paired with every compressor sale)**
- Refrigerated dryers: Hankison, Ingersoll Rand, Quincy (35-42°F dew point, $1.5K-$8K)
- Desiccant dryers: Hankison, Nano-Purification, Super-Dry (-40°F to -100°F dew point, $3K-$25K)
- Filtration: Hankison, Deltech, Pneumatech, BEKO (particulate, coalescing, activated carbon)

This product intelligence is encoded in the substrate (brands.krf, taxonomy.krf, specifications.krf) and drives Protocol 3 (Product Cross-Reference) and Protocol 1 (Pricing Intelligence). Charlotte doesn't just know the market — Charlotte knows every product in the market, who makes it, who sells it, what it costs, and what it competes against.

---

## Part 5: Competitive Pricing Landscape

### 5.1 Online Pricing Transparency

The compressed air market is experiencing rapid price transparency compression. Online retailers publish prices. Manufacturer MAP (Minimum Advertised Price) policies vary in enforcement. Amazon's marketplace creates downward pressure on branded equipment.

**Charlotte's pricing intelligence (Protocol 1) tracks:**
- CompressorWorld.com (101 brands, 14 categories — the benchmark)
- CompressorPros.com (40+ brands, piston and light industrial)
- CompressorsNow.com (FS-Curtis, Champion, Mattei focus)
- Amazon (growing compressed air equipment category)

**Pricing observation frequency:** Daily scraping of the top 100 SKUs. Each observation becomes a SIGNAL on the price METRIC line for that SKU. Over time, Charlotte builds a complete price history for every competitor product — seasonal patterns, promotional cycles, MAP enforcement gaps, and category-specific price trends.

### 5.2 Margin Architecture

| Revenue Stream | Typical Margin | Charlotte Impact |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| New equipment sales | 20-30% | Protocol 1 optimizes pricing against competitors → +200-300 bps |
| Parts and consumables | 35-50% | Cross-reference tables identify margin uplift opportunities |
| Service labor | 45-60% | Protocol 4 optimizes service scheduling → reduce truck rolls |
| Service agreements (bundled) | 30-40% | Total Care Bundle captures full margin stack |
| Energy consulting | 60-75% | New revenue stream — pure expertise, minimal COGS |

**The margin stack:** A customer on the Total Care Bundle generates blended margin of 35-45% across equipment, parts, and labor. A customer buying parts from CompressorNow and calling ISG for emergency service generates 15-25% blended margin — worse margin on more expensive (reactive) service. The bundle isn't just better for the customer. It's dramatically better for ISG's margin structure.

## Part 6: Charlotte Deployment Timeline Alignment

The market penetration strategy aligns directly with the Charlotte deployment phases defined in the ISG contract:

| Phase | Weeks | Charlotte Milestone | Market Impact |
|-------|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| **1. Engage** | 1-2 (Mar 2026) | Kickoff, NetSuite data audit, substrate initialization | Map existing customer base, identify dormant accounts |
| **2. Drive** | 3-16 (Mar-Jun 2026) | Historical data integration, KG construction, competitive scraping | **Week 8 (Apr):** First competitive pricing data delivered. Protocol 1 operational. |
| **3. Enable** | 17-40 (Jul-Nov 2026) | Reactivation campaigns launch, pricing intelligence active | **Week 16 (Jun):** Protocol 2 launches. Dormant customers targeted. **Week 24 (Aug):** Full platform operational. All 4 protocols running. |
| **4. Stabilize** | 41-52 (Dec 2026-Feb 2027) | Performance optimization, ROI case study | Documented ROI justifies Year 2+ platform investment and Pinnacle/ASE expansion. |

**First value at Week 8:** Charlotte delivers competitive pricing data on the top 100 SKUs within 60 days of contract start. This alone pays for months of implementation — a single margin improvement of 200 bps on ISG's compressor parts revenue generates measurable return immediately.

**Full protocol suite at Week 24:** By August 2026, Charlotte is watching every competitor price, reactivating dormant customers, cross-referencing products for cross-sell, and tracking the installed base for lifecycle replacement. This is when the $8.7-$12.5M annual revenue uplift begins.

---

## Part 7: The Substrate Architecture

Every data point in this market analysis maps to the compressor substrate. The substrate is the bedrock layer — it sits on top of Charlotte OS's five primitives and encodes everything ISG needs to know about the compressed air market.

**Substrate file manifest (19 KRF files, 11,773 lines, 907 product instances):**

```
compressors/
  README.krf                                    — domain overview and inheritance
  kernel/
    types.krf                                   — 538 lines: equipment, market, catalog types
    predicates.krf                              — 540 lines: relationships and attributes
  knowledge/
    meta/
      schema.krf                                — primitive mapping and file manifest
    structural/
      taxonomy.krf                              — 11 categories, 100+ subcategories, 7 HP tiers
      brands.krf                                — 120+ brands in 10 tiers with ownership
      retailers.krf                             — CompressorWorld, CompressorNow, ACS, ISG
    heuristic/
      specifications.krf                        — performance specs, pricing, energy benchmarks
    procedural/
      pricing_intelligence.krf                  — 4 protocols: pricing, reactivation, xref, lifecycle
  output/
    nodes/
      rotary_screw.krf                          — rotary screw compressor instances
      piston.krf                                — reciprocating compressor instances
      oilfree_scroll.krf                        — oil-free scroll compressor instances
      dryers.krf                                — air dryer instances
      blowers.krf                               — blower instances
      vacuum.krf                                — vacuum pump instances
      nitrogen.krf                              — nitrogen generator instances
      engine_driven.krf                         — portable/engine-driven instances
      total_air_systems.krf                     — complete packaged systems
      acs_competitor.krf                        — ACS competitive product data
```

**This is what "every layer of KRF files is just another OS" means:**
- Charlotte OS defines the five primitives (NODE, EDGE, METRIC, SIGNAL, PROTOCOL)
- The compressor substrate extends those primitives with domain-specific types (RotaryScrew, RefrigeratedDryer, Manufacturer, EndUser)
- The output nodes materialize the substrate into concrete product instances (907 compressors, dryers, blowers, vacuum pumps with prices and specifications)
- ISG's operational data (from NetSuite, HubSpot, BigCommerce) will layer on top as a third OS — customer NODEs, purchase SIGNALs, service EDGEs
- The intelligence protocols (pricing, reactivation, cross-reference, lifecycle) are the PROTOCOL layer that governs how the graph evolves

Each layer inherits from the layer below. Each layer extends the ontology for its specific domain. The Mckinsey market study, when it arrives, will add a fourth layer — macroeconomic context, industry growth rates, consolidation trends, and regulatory drivers — encoded as structural knowledge that the protocols can reference when making recommendations.

The compressed air market is 62,275 facilities waiting to become NODEs in Charlotte's graph. This document is the map. The substrate is the engine. The launch meeting on February 24 is where we turn it on.
