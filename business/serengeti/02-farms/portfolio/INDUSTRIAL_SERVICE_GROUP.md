## What Is ISG?

The Industrial Service Group is Jim Richard's existing portfolio of 16 industrial brands spanning service, distribution, and field operations across five verticals: Valves & Actuation, Compressors, Pumps, Motors & Drives, and Specialty Field Service. This is not a startup — it's a **proven, operating business** with ~1,200 employees generating ~$450M in annual revenue.

ISG is relevant to Serengeti because:
1. It proves the Richard Enterprises team can operate at massive scale
2. Charlotte™ (its knowledge graph deployment) validates the Charlotte substrate commercially
3. The contract structure (deployment + ongoing service) becomes the template for all future SomeAI clients

## Charlotte™ at ISG: Compressor Vertical First

Charlotte™ is deployed at ISG starting with the Compressor Vertical (Industrial Air Power + Industrial Air Centers). It transforms industrial distribution from reactive to predictive through bi-directional integration with ISG's existing systems.

## Market Context

Industrial distribution in the U.S. is a **$6+ trillion industry** with extremely fragmented technology adoption. Most distributors run on ERP systems from the 1990s, manual reorder processes, and paper-based field operations.

Charlotte™ at ISG brings:
- **Predictive intelligence** to a sector that's still mostly reactive
- **Unified data** across brands that traditionally operate as siloed P&Ls
- **Real-time signals** from field operations flowing into graph-based analytics
- **Bi-directional integration** — Charlotte doesn't just read data, it writes back recommendations

## Why ISG Matters for Serengeti

ISG is the **proof of concept** that Charlotte works at commercial scale. If Charlotte can manage ~1,200 employees across 16 brands with predictive distribution, it can manage:
- Show pig breeding operations (Sounder)
- Nightlife venue networks
- Luxury real estate portfolios (Oasis)
- Any future Farms vertical

ISG de-risks the entire Serengeti thesis. It's not "will Charlotte work?" — it's "where else does Charlotte work?"

### Expansion Path
- **Phase 1 (Current):** Compressor Vertical (IAP + IAC)
- **Phase 2 (TBD):** Pinnacle Industrial & ASE — additional implementation costs quoted separately
- **Phase 3 (TBD):** Full ISG platform — all 16 brands on Charlotte™
