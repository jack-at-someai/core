## Company Position

Monroe Livestock Auction (MLA) is a weekly livestock auction barn located at 1871 E 200 S, Monroe, IN 46772, in Adams County, Indiana — the heart of the Swiss Amish corridor in northeastern Indiana. Revenue is estimated at $500K–$1.5M annually with 3–8 employees. Sale day is every Tuesday: livestock at 11 AM, small animals and poultry at 5 PM. MLA operates a multi-species auction covering cattle, horses (driving, draft, saddle), small animals, poultry, and seasonal exotics, serving a buyer base split between in-person Amish cash buyers and remote online bidders via DVAuction broadcast and internet bidding. Current technology footprint is minimal — no CRM, no ERP, paper/cash/manual settlement — placing MLA at a data maturity score of 0–1 on the Charlotte scale.

## Direct Competitors (Tier 1)

| Company | Location | Sale Day | Species | Differentiator |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Topeka Livestock Auction** | Topeka, IN (LaGrange Co.) — 60 mi N | **Tuesday** (direct same-day conflict) | Feeder cattle, replacement cattle, slaughter cattle, dairy cattle, draft horses | One of the largest draft horse auctions in the world. Percheron gelding world record $165,000. Buyers from 24 states, 4 countries. USDA-reported (AMS_3415). YouTube livestream. |
| **Shipshewana Trading Place / Livestock Auction** | Shipshewana, IN (LaGrange Co.) — 65 mi N | Wednesday (livestock), Friday (horses) | Cattle (dairy & beef), hogs, feeder pigs, sheep, lambs, goats, veal, horses, ponies, hay | Founded 1922 (100+ years). Largest multi-species barn in NE Indiana. Special horse sales Good Friday + day-after-Thanksgiving (300+ horses each). Buyer's premium 5%. Seller commission 8% (horses). No online bidding. |
| **Stony Pike Livestock Auction** | Logansport, IN (Cass Co.) — 80 mi W | Thursday | Full cattle auction | USDA-reported (report 1969). Weekly cattle-focused. Website: indianalivestockauction.com. |

**Key Tier 1 observation:** Topeka runs the same Tuesday sale day as Monroe, directly splitting the buyer pool across the NE Indiana corridor. Topeka has USDA market reporting and world-class draft horse reputation — Monroe does not. Shipshewana operates the largest multi-species barn in the region with 100+ years of brand equity and a different sale day (Wednesday), making it a complementary-but-dominant neighbor.

## Supply Chain Map

### Upstream (Sellers / Consignors)
- **Local farmers and ranchers** — Adams County and NE Indiana agricultural operations
- **Amish / Swiss Amish community** — Horse breeders (Standardbreds for buggy, Percherons/Belgians for draft), small animal producers, poultry operations
- **4-H / FFA youth exhibitors** — Seasonal consignments tied to fair calendars
- **Regional feedlot operators** — Feeder calves cycling through auction for placement
- **Horse breeders** — Driving horses, draft horses, ponies from across the Amish corridor

### Downstream (Buyers)
- **Amish buyers** — Driving horses, draft horses, buggy horses (overwhelmingly cash transactions, in-person)
- **Feedlot operators** — Feeder calves purchased for grow-out
- **Order buyers** — Professional buyers purchasing on behalf of absent clients
- **Direct consumers** — Small animals, poultry, seasonal exotics (walk-up retail buyers)
- **Remote online bidders** — Via DVAuction broadcast; geographic reach unknown (no analytics)
- **Exotic animal collectors** — Seasonal, event-driven

### Adjacent Players
- **DVAuction** — Broadcast and online bidding technology partner (incumbent infrastructure)
- **National Beef Wire** — Marketing and broadcast network for cattle auctions
- **USDA AMS** — Market reporting authority; 7 Indiana markets participate, Monroe does NOT
- **Indiana State Dept of Agriculture (ISDA)** — Administers state market reporting program
- **Veterinarians** — Vaccine verification required for feeder sales; health certificates for interstate transport
- **Trucking / hauling services** — Buyer-arranged livestock transport post-sale

## Market Size & Growth

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Indiana cattle inventory (Jan 2025) | 810,000 head (+3% YoY) | USDA NASS |
| US cattle inventory (Jan 2025) | 86.7M head | USDA NASS |
| Indiana share of US cattle | ~0.9% | Derived |
| Indiana equine inventory | 160,000 head statewide | USDA / Indiana Horse Council |
| Adams County equine | 2,400 head on 13 operations | USDA Census of Agriculture |
| LaGrange County equine (largest in state) | 11,200 head | USDA Census of Agriculture |
| Indiana work horses (Amish-owned) | 17,290 statewide | USDA / Amish studies |
| Indiana livestock auction barns | ~15–20 total | Industry estimate |
| USDA/ISDA-reported markets (Indiana) | 7 participating | ISDA |
| USDA-reported cattle transactions (Indiana) | ~100,000/year across 7 markets | USDA AMS |

**TAM / SAM / SOM:**
No comprehensive TAM/SAM for "weekly livestock auctions" exists — the market is hyperlocal and fragmented. Each barn's catchment area is defined by driving distance (typically 60–90 minutes), sale day timing, species mix, and community affiliation (Amish/non-Amish). Monroe's serviceable market is the NE Indiana corridor: Adams, Allen, Wells, Jay, Blackford, DeKalb, and Noble counties, with horse buyers drawn from the broader Amish belt stretching into LaGrange, Elkhart, and across the Ohio/Michigan border.

**Growth signals:**
- Indiana cattle inventory growing (+3% YoY) — positive for feeder auction volume
- Amish population doubling every 18–22 years — structural tailwind for horse and small animal demand
- DVAuction integration expands addressable buyer pool beyond local geography
- No new auction barns opening in NE Indiana corridor — supply side is static

## Competitive Positioning

### Where Monroe Wins Today
- **Only dedicated weekly livestock barn in Adams County** — no same-county competitor for regular weekly sales
- **Heart of the Swiss Amish corridor** — built-in buyer community with deep cultural ties to in-person auction purchasing
- **Multi-species diversity** — Cattle + horses + small animals + exotics in a single operation creates year-round revenue streams that single-species barns cannot match
- **DVAuction integration** — Expands buyer reach beyond the local Amish community to remote online bidders across the country
- **Specialty sale calendar** — Driving horses, draft horses, ponies, exotics create event-driven attendance spikes that compound regular Tuesday traffic

### Where Monroe Is Vulnerable
- **Same Tuesday sale day as Topeka** — Direct split of the buyer pool with a barn that has USDA reporting, world-record horse prices, and buyers from 24 states
- **NOT in USDA market reporting program** — Competitors (Topeka, Stony Pike) are USDA-reported, giving their prices institutional credibility and market visibility that Monroe lacks
- **No digital presence beyond basic website + Facebook** — In an industry moving toward online bidding and livestream, Monroe's marketing reach is constrained to word-of-mouth and DVAuction's platform
- **Smaller scale than Shipshewana and Topeka** — Both competitors have larger facilities, longer histories, and stronger brand recognition across the region
- **No data strategy whatsoever** — Paper tickets, cash transactions, manual everything. Zero visibility into buyer patterns, seasonal demand curves, price trends, or consignor performance
- **Horse sale market dominated by Topeka** — World-record draft horse prices at Topeka create a gravity well that pulls premium horse consignors away from Monroe

### Where Charlotte Creates Defensible Advantage
- **USDA market report automation** — Currently manual PDFs across the industry; Charlotte ingests, structures, and tracks USDA reports to benchmark Monroe prices against Topeka and Shipshewana per category, per week, automatically
- **Buyer intelligence** — Repeat buyer identification, species preferences, bid-to-purchase conversion rates, seasonal demand curves — none of which exist today at any auction barn this size
- **Cross-sale analytics** — Which specialty sales (driving horses, draft horses, exotics) drive the most revenue per head? Which events generate the highest buyer attendance? Charlotte makes the calendar a data instrument
- **Consignor reporting** — Automated settlement summaries, price comparisons against regional averages, consignor lifetime value tracking — replacing paper tickets with structured intelligence
- **DVAuction data correlation** — Online bids vs in-person bids, geographic buyer spread, online-to-in-person conversion. The "dual market" (Amish in-person + remote online) is completely invisible today — Charlotte makes both visible and comparable
- **Competitive benchmarking** — Track Topeka and Shipshewana prices vs Monroe prices per species, per weight class, per sale type. Turn USDA market reports into a competitive dashboard instead of a PDF nobody reads
- **The Amish data gap** — Cash-dominant, paper-based, no digital records. Every other industry has been digitized; the Amish livestock corridor has not. Charlotte is the first system that can observe this market without requiring the participants to change how they operate — it sits at the barn level, not the buyer level
