# Monroe Livestock Auction × Charlotte

---

## Slide 1: What We See

You filed 52 market reports last year. We already read them all.

Charlotte has ingested every publicly available USDA market report for Indiana livestock auctions. Before this meeting started, we already knew:

- Which weeks your cattle volume peaks
- When feeder calf prices dip below regional average
- Your seasonal attendance patterns across Tuesday sales

Your barn tells a story every Tuesday. Right now, nobody's listening.

> **52 weeks of auction data. Zero weeks of intelligence.**

## Slide 2: Your World Today

Tyler runs the sale on Tuesday. Files a USDA-format market report. Reconciles cash and check payments. Repeats next week. This is the rhythm, and it works — but it leaves everything on the table.

**Current tools:**
- DVAuction for live broadcast
- Paper consignment sheets
- Manual settlement (cash/check)
- Facebook for sale announcements

**Data maturity: 1 out of 5** — PDF reports exist but nobody analyzes them. No trends. No buyer intelligence. No competitive positioning.

**Blind spots:**
- Who are your repeat buyers?
- Which consignors bring the most volume?
- Do your driving horse sales outperform your feeder specials?
- What is the online vs floor bid ratio?
- Nobody knows.

You're running one of Adams County's most important community institutions on paper and instinct.

## Slide 3: What Becomes Observable

| Before (Today) | After (Charlotte) |
|---|---|
| Paper market reports filed and forgotten | Living price trend dashboard updated every Tuesday |
| No buyer tracking (especially cash Amish buyers) | Anonymized buyer patterns: repeat rates, species preferences, seasonal attendance |
| Manual settlement with cash/check | Settlement tracking with automated consignor statements |
| No competitive intelligence | Weekly price benchmarking vs Topeka and Shipshewana |
| Specialty sales scheduled by tradition | Data-driven specialty sale optimization (which types draw the most revenue?) |
| DVAuction as a black box | Online vs floor bid analytics showing geographic market reach |

## Slide 4: The Charlotte Substrate

We've already modeled your operation.

A 347-line knowledge graph representing Monroe Livestock Auction's complete domain:

| Primitive | Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Node types** | 7 | Animals, Sellers, Buyers, Sales, Species, Breeds, Categories |
| **Edge types** | 7 | consigned, sold, bought, breed, species, vaccine, broadcast |
| **Metric types** | 7 | headcount, average, clearance, price/CWT, attendance, repeat rate, online ratio |
| **Signal types** | 5 | consignment, bid, hammer, payment, report |
| **Protocol types** | 7 | intake, auction, vaccine verify, broadcast, USDA report, settlement, horse booking |

This is what Monroe Livestock Auction looks like as data. Every Tuesday adds to it.

## Slide 5: What Changes

Concrete outcomes once Charlotte is operational:

1. **4-6 hours/week saved** on manual reporting and settlement reconciliation
2. **Pricing intelligence** — Know when Topeka's feeder prices are weak. Pull consignors to Monroe.
3. **Buyer retention** — Identify regular buyers who stop showing up before you lose them
4. **Specialty sale ROI** — Data shows which specialty sales (driving horses vs exotics vs draft) earn the most per head
5. **USDA compliance** — Charlotte generates market reports from sale data, replacing manual PDF creation
6. **DVAuction insights** — See what percentage of your final hammer prices come from online bidders vs floor

## Slide 6: How It Works

Three phases. No disruption to the Tuesday rhythm.

### Foundation (Weeks 1-8)
We ingest your last 12 months of market reports. Dashboard goes live. Monthly meetings with Tyler to capture consignment and settlement data.

### Operations (Months 3-6)
DVAuction data added. Buyer patterns emerge. Consignor reporting automated. USDA report generation from Charlotte data.

### Intelligence (Months 7-12)
Seasonal predictions. Competitive benchmarking. Buyer retention alerts. Cross-auction intelligence (connects to Sounder's livestock graph).

No new hardware. No buyer-facing changes. Your Amish customers will never see a screen — Charlotte watches from the barn side.

## Slide 7: Investment

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| **Deployment (one-time)** | $7,500 — substrate creation, historical data ingestion, dashboard deployment |
| **Monthly service** | $2,500/mo — Charlotte operation, monthly meetings, quarterly reports, dashboard updates |
| **2-year commitment** | **$67,500 total** ($7,500 + $60,000) |

**ROI math:** If Charlotte helps Monroe improve revenue by just 3% on a $1M/year operation, that's $30K/year — pays for itself in year one.

This is less than what you'd pay one part-time employee. Charlotte never misses a Tuesday.
