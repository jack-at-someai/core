# Monroe Livestock Auction — Cost Analysis & Tier Recommendation

## Client Financial Profile
- Annual revenue: $500K–$1.5M (estimated from weekly auction volume, commission-based)
- Estimated operating margin: 15–25% (auction commission model, low overhead)
- Technology budget (estimated or stated): ~$0/yr (DVAuction subscription likely $200–500/mo is their only tech spend)
- Decision-maker appetite for technology investment: Low — Tyler Bluhm is an owner-operator in a cash-heavy, price-sensitive market with an Amish buyer base. No digital systems beyond DVAuction for online simulcast. Data maturity score: 1 (PDF reports, paper/cash, no digital infrastructure).

## SomeAI Service Tiers

### Foundation — $2,500/mo ($30K/yr)
- Charlotte substrate setup (KRF knowledge graph)
- Monthly ingestion meetings (manual observation capture)
- Quarterly before/after reports
- Basic dashboard (index.html visualization)
- **Best for:** <$5M revenue, proof-of-concept phase

### Operations — $5,000/mo ($60K/yr)
- Everything in Foundation
- Real-time signal capture (IoT sensors, API integrations)
- Automated metric tracking
- Protocol engine (workflow monitoring)

- **Best for:** $5M-$25M revenue, operational intelligence

### Charlotte OS — $10,000/mo ($120K/yr)
- Everything in Operations
- Full Charlotte OS deployment
- Custom visualization dashboards
- Predictive modeling (METRIC trend analysis)
- Dedicated SomeAI engineer
- **Best for:** $25M+ revenue, full digital twin

### Enterprise — $25,000-$100,000/mo
- Custom scope, multi-facility, multi-domain
- PE-grade reporting and analytics
- **Best for:** PE-backed portfolios, multi-site operations

## Recommendation
- **Recommended tier:** Foundation ($2,500/mo)
- **Rationale:** Monroe's revenue sits well below $5M, placing it squarely in Foundation territory per SomeAI's inference rules. The operation is a single location with 3–8 employees, zero existing digital infrastructure, and a data maturity score of 1. Foundation tier delivers the highest-impact transformation for this profile: Charlotte substrate creation, monthly ingestion meetings to capture observations from an entirely manual workflow, quarterly before/after reporting to prove ROI, and a basic dashboard that gives Tyler Bluhm visibility he has never had. No real-time signal capture or IoT integration is justified at this stage — there is nothing digital to connect to.
- **Stretch tier:** Operations ($5,000/mo). This would be justified if Monroe onboards DVAuction API integration for real-time online/in-person bid correlation, adds USDA market report API feeds for automated competitive pricing intelligence, or if Tyler expands to a second sale day per week. The trigger is digital signal sources coming online — until then, Foundation covers the full scope.
- **ROI thesis:** Charlotte needs to save or generate approximately $30K/year to break even against the Foundation tier cost. Three value drivers make this achievable:
  1. **Reporting automation:** Monroe files 52 USDA-format market reports per year, all manually compiled. Charlotte automates this, saving 4–6 hours per week (208–312 hours/year). At an implied labor cost of $20–25/hr for clerk time, that is $4,200–$7,800/year recovered.
  2. **Pricing intelligence:** Charlotte maps competitive pricing against Topeka and Shipshewana auctions. When Topeka prices are weak, Monroe can pull consignors — even a 3% gross revenue improvement on $1M in annual throughput equals $30K.
  3. **Buyer intelligence:** No buyer analytics exist today. Charlotte identifies repeat buyer patterns, seasonal demand curves by species, and at-risk regulars who stop attending. Retaining even 2–3 significant buyers who would otherwise drift to competing auctions protects $10K–$50K in annual commission revenue.
  4. **Settlement reconciliation:** Manual cash/check accounting for consignor payouts is error-prone and time-consuming. Charlotte tracks settlement automatically, reducing reconciliation time and eliminating costly errors.
  5. **Cross-sale analytics:** Charlotte reveals which specialty sales (driving horses, exotics, feeders) generate the highest margin, enabling Tyler to allocate marketing and scheduling resources to the most profitable categories.

  Conservative estimate: $30K–$50K in combined savings and revenue enablement against a $30K annual cost. Payback is achievable within Year 1.

## Contract Structure
- **Contract 1 — Deployment & Migration:** One-time substrate creation, initial data ingestion (52 weeks of historical USDA market reports), dashboard deployment, and first ingestion meeting.
  - Estimated: $7,500 (3x monthly rate — appropriate for low-complexity, single-location deployment with primarily manual data ingestion)
  - Payment: 50% upfront ($3,750) / 50% on completion ($3,750)
  - Timeline: 4–8 weeks (Migration Path C — Pilot POC)
- **Contract 2 — Ongoing Service:** Monthly Charlotte operation, ingestion meetings, quarterly reports, dashboard updates, support.
  - Rate: $2,500/mo, 24-month commitment with auto-renewal
  - Annual escalator: 3–5%
  - Termination: 90-day notice, early termination fee = remaining months x 50%
- **Total 2-year value:** $67,500 ($7,500 deployment + $60,000 ongoing service)
