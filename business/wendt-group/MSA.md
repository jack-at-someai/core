## 2. SCOPE OF PARTNERSHIP

**2.1 Partnership Model.** This is a strategic technology partnership — not a standard vendor engagement. The Technology Partner provides Charlotte OS infrastructure to modernize and extend the Industry Partner's auction platforms. The Industry Partner provides industry access, historical data, and distribution channels. Both Parties benefit from the resulting platform capabilities.

**2.2 Phase 1 — Foundation (Months 1–6).** During the Foundation Phase, the Technology Partner will deploy:

- (a) **Brand identity and digital presence** — Consolidated visual identity, design system, and modernized web presence for The Wendt Group and ShowPig.com
- (b) **Domain discovery and operational walkthrough** — On-site visit to Plain City, OH headquarters and observation of live auction operations (minimum 2 live auctions attended)
- (c) **Knowledge graph seeding** — Initial Substrate deployment with entity nodes (breeders, buyers, animals, sires, dams, auction lots, sales) and relationship edges from historical ShowPig.com data
- (d) **Auction data pipeline** — Ingestion of historical sale records from ShowPig.com into Charlotte KRF format, structured by breeder, animal, price, date, buyer, and pedigree
- (e) **Breeder CRM** — Unified breeder graph spanning all Platform operations. Every breeder modeled as a NODE with sale history, buying patterns, genetic program, and lifetime metrics
- (f) **Pedigree integration baseline** — Initial mapping of registered pedigrees from NSR data accessible through the Industry Partner's existing relationships, cross-referenced with sale catalog sire/dam listings
- (g) **Competitive intelligence baseline** — Mapping of the Industry Partner's competitive landscape including Show Circuit Online Sales, StockShowAuctions.com, SaleRing.Live, and EZ2Bid
- (h) **Platform audit** — Technical assessment of ShowPig.com infrastructure (Azure, JWT auth, email identity system) for Charlotte integration readiness

**2.3 Phase 2 — Operations (Months 7–24).** Following the Foundation Phase, the Technology Partner will expand to:

- (a) **Crossbred pedigree engine** — Charlotte-powered ancestry reconstruction for unregistered animals using sale catalog data, breeder records, and sire/dam naming patterns. The centerpiece deliverable of this partnership.
- (b) **Sale intelligence** — Predictive pricing, optimal timing recommendations, and targeted buyer matching based on historical sale patterns and genetic premium analysis
- (c) **Breeder analytics dashboard** — Lifetime revenue tracking, genetic impact scoring (sire influence on sale averages), buyer network mapping, and program trajectory analysis
- (d) **Auction performance metrics** — Per-sale analytics: lot count, bidder count, sale average, top lot, clearance rate, bidder-to-lot ratio, and comparison to historical benchmarks
- (e) **Show result integration** — Ingestion of NSR show data (Summer Spectacular, Exposition, state fairs) into the Substrate, linking show placement to breeding and sale outcomes
- (f) **Weekly analytics delivery** — Sale performance, breeder activity, pricing trends, and pedigree graph growth metrics
- (g) **Protocol management** — Auction booking workflows, lot submission protocols, bidder verification, settlement and Pork Checkoff compliance, pedigree verification, and sale day production checklists
- (h) **Drift alerts** — Notification when monitored metrics deviate from expected trajectories: sale average decline, bidder drop-off, settlement delays, pedigree data gaps, or competitive platform shifts
- (i) **Registry integration pipeline** — Automated data exchange pathways with NSR, CPS, and ABA for pedigree verification and registration processing
- (j) **Quarterly strategic review** — Partnership review with Industry Partner leadership, including platform growth metrics, pedigree graph coverage, and expansion planning
