## Company Position

The Wendt Group, Inc. (est. 1986) is the **dominant online show pig auction platform** in North America. ShowPig.com hosted the first-ever online show pig auction on March 21, 2004, and has since conducted over **12,000 online auctions** and **6,500 live auctions**. 20,000+ email subscribers. Kevin Wendt is an Ohio Auctioneers Hall of Fame inductee with 40+ years of experience conducting 125+ live auctions per year.

The business model is **full-service auction infrastructure** — not just a platform, but auctioneering, clerking, settlement, marketing, photography/videography, sales advising, and post-sale collections. This is a vertically integrated service wrapped around a technology platform, touching every step from lot submission to payment settlement.

Four platforms under one roof: ShowPig.com (show pig auctions), CattleConnect.com (cattle auctions), Showpig LIVE (hybrid live+online via Kennedy Ventures/CCi.live), and TWG Auctions (equipment/general).

## Revenue Estimation

The Wendt Group is privately held with no public revenue disclosures. The following estimation uses industry benchmarks and operational signals:

### Method 1: Online Auction Commission
- ~600 online auctions/year (12,000 total over ~20 years)
- Average 30–50 lots per auction at ~$963 avg sale price (2013 ShowPig.com data)
- Commission structure: 10% standard (The Debut is explicit: "$25/head, 10%")
- 600 auctions × 40 lots × $963 × 10% = **$2.3M**
- Prices have appreciated since 2013; adjusted estimate: **$2.5M–$4M**

### Method 2: Live Auction Revenue
- 125 live auctions/year × typical gross of $75K–$250K per sale
- Auctioneer fee + clerking + settlement: 5–8% of gross
- 125 × $150K × 6.5% = **$1.2M**
- Plus travel, setup, equipment rental: **$1.5M–$2.5M**

### Method 3: Marketing & Advertising Revenue
- 20,000+ email subscriber blasts — breeder newsletter is premium placement
- Banner ads on ShowPig.com and CattleConnect.com
- Breeder directory listings ($500–$2,000/year per listing)
- Photography/video packages for sale catalogs
- Estimated: **$300K–$800K**

### Method 4: Adjacent Revenue
- CattleConnect.com (American Shorthorn Association ~10-year partnership)
- Real estate brokerage (Wendt-Wise / Murray Wise Associates — $5B+ completed transactions as partners)
- Equipment auctions (TWG Auctions)
- Sales Advisor Team (launched 2024 — farm visits, pig evaluation, consulting)
- Estimated: **$500K–$1.5M**

### Consolidated Estimate

| Scenario | Annual Revenue | Basis |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Conservative | $3.5M | Online commissions + live auctions |
| Base Case | $5.5M | Full service stack + marketing + CattleConnect |
| Aggressive | $8M | All revenue streams + real estate + advisory |

**Working estimate: $4M–$6M annual revenue.** High margins on the online platform (low marginal cost per auction), lower margins on live auctioneering (travel, labor). The Sales Advisor Team (2024 launch) signals growth investment.

## Technology Landscape

### Current State (industry-wide)
- Most auction platforms are **PHP/MySQL monoliths** built 15–20 years ago
- ShowPig.com runs on **Microsoft Azure** with **JWT (HS256) auth** and email-based unified accounts
- Pedigree data exists in **siloed registry databases** — no cross-registry integration
- Sale records often exist only in **PDF catalogs and Facebook posts**
- Genetic testing data (GeneSeek, stress gene status) disconnected from sale/breeding records
- No standardized data format across the industry

### Emerging
- CCi.live / Showpig LIVE — hybrid live+online auction with video streaming
- Electronic show entry and results management
- DNA-verified parentage confirmation
- Mobile bidding apps replacing phone-bid clerking

### What Doesn't Exist Yet (Sounder's Opportunity)
- **Crossbred pedigree system** — 60%+ of show pigs have zero registered lineage
- **Unified breeder graph** — no system connects a breeder's animals across registries and sale platforms
- **Predictive genetics** — genetic value modeling from breeding + show + sale data combined
- **Cross-platform sale analytics** — how does a sire's progeny perform across ShowPig.com, SC Online, and private treaty?
- **Industry-wide CRM** — who buys from whom, where do buyers travel, what genetics do they prefer?

## Sounder Thesis for The Wendt Group

**"The Wendt Group runs the dominant auction platform in a $500M+ show pig market — and the entire industry's data is trapped in silos."**

ShowPig.com has 20+ years of sale data: who sold what, to whom, at what price, with what pedigree. That data is the foundation for everything Sounder needs to build — but today it's locked in a legacy platform with no graph infrastructure.

The registries (NSR, CPS, ABA) own pedigree data. The breeders own genetic knowledge. The auction platforms own sale data. The show systems own performance data. **Nobody connects them.**

Sounder's Charlotte substrate connects all five:
- Every **Animal** is a NODE with ear notch, breed, registration, sire/dam lineage
- Every **Breeder** is a NODE with herd history, buying patterns, genetic program
- Every **Sale** is a SIGNAL stream (lot listed → bid placed → sale closed → settlement completed)
- Every **Pedigree** is an EDGE chain (hasSire → hasGrandsire → hasGreatGrandsire)
- Every **Show Result** is a METRIC (class placement, judge, division, weight)

The Wendt Group partnership gives Sounder:
1. **Distribution** — 20,000 email subscribers, 125+ live auctions/year, breeder directory
2. **Data** — 20 years of sale records, bidder behavior, pricing trends
3. **Credibility** — Kevin Wendt is an Ohio Hall of Fame auctioneer, former NSR Board
4. **Infrastructure** — ShowPig.com is the platform where breeders already transact

In return, Sounder gives The Wendt Group:
1. **Crossbred pedigree** — ancestry tracking for animals that have never been registered
2. **Breeder analytics** — lifetime revenue, genetic impact scores, buyer network mapping
3. **Sale intelligence** — predictive pricing, optimal timing, targeted buyer matching
4. **Platform modernization** — Charlotte substrate replaces legacy tech with graph infrastructure
5. **Registry integration** — unified view across NSR, CPS, ABA, and crossbred databases

This isn't a vendor contract. This is the partnership that stitches the swine industry's data layer together. ShowPig.com + Charlotte = the platform every breeder, buyer, and registry needs.
