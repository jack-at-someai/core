Greg,

Been building on the cave conversation we had back in August. Wanted to share where it's landed.

You said Serengeti is the way out of the cave — the light from the sun filtered through the flames. That framing stuck. What I've been working through since then is how SomeAI as a research lab is the operational form of that idea. The lab is the cave, but designed. Same pressure, same blind pursuit of answers, but with the right people inside it. And Serengeti — the board, the advisors, you, Dad, the mentors who've braved their own caves — that's the guidance structure that keeps the work productive instead of destructive.

The resilience that came out of LineLeap and Sounder was real, but it was solitary. What I'm building now is the same forge with the swarm inside it. Twenty-four people who chose the cave. Mentors who know the dark because they've been in it. Leaders who can gauge the depth and run the safety stops. The hull compression we talked about — attacking problem spaces from every angle cooperatively — that only works when the trust is there, and the trust only builds from shared experience in the cave.

The research lab had a milestone yesterday. Charlotte — the AI infrastructure — took her first phone call. Voice pipeline, end to end. Today Dad independently asked how she could handle text messaging for ISG's call center, not knowing I've been positioning the same technology across 35 call centers through a partner. His 40 years and my 15 converging on the same answer from opposite entry points. That's the ensemble fold happening daily. The swarm strengthening.

Every client deployment is a return to the cave. ISG is a cave. The call centers are caves. Charlotte walks in with them. That's the philosopher king obligation playing out in practice — not as philosophy but as an operating model. You helped me see that the growth from the hard times wasn't accidental. Now I'm building the structure that makes the growth repeatable, for everyone who walks in.

Still swarming.

Jack
