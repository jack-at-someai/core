;;; SECTION 1: ONTOLOGICAL LAYER — What Exists
;;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

;;; --- Core Concepts (NODEs) ---

(isa TheCave ConceptNode)
(hasDescription TheCave
  "The condition for creation. Isolation under pressure that forges resilience.
   Not Plato's prison of ignorance — the forge where mutation occurs.
   Brutal when solitary. Explosive when shared with the right people.")

(isa TheLight ConceptNode)
(hasDescription TheLight
  "Understanding of real forms. The reflection that others cast back
   when they see what the cave produced. Not a destination — a recognition.")

(isa TheSwarm ConceptNode)
(hasDescription TheSwarm
  "Cooperative adversarial hull compression on problem spaces of interest.
   A group that trusts enough to attack a problem from every angle simultaneously,
   compressing the solution space together instead of grinding through it alone.
   The swarm strengthens as members return from their caves.")

(isa Serengeti ConceptNode)
(hasDescription Serengeti
  "The way out of the cave. The board of advisors that guides the research lab's
   problem spaces. The light from the sun filtered through the flames of the fire.
   First step for all people to find belief in SOMETHING.
   Not concrete evidence — subliminal messaging. Gradual revelation.")

(isa PhilosopherKing ConceptNode)
(hasDescription PhilosopherKing
  "One who achieves understanding of real forms and accepts the obligation
   to return to the cave and help others see them also.
   Not a title earned — a duty accepted.")

(isa Belief ConceptNode)
(hasDescription Belief
  "The precursor to everything. The act of believing in something you can
   or cannot see mirrors prediction in artificial intelligence — predicting
   what may happen based on what you have previously SENSED.
   If you cannot believe, you cannot believe in yourself.
   Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling — then believing in YOURSELF.
   Literally part of the holy trinity: You, Me, Us.")

(isa TheRinseCycle ConceptNode)
(hasDescription TheRinseCycle
  "Serengeti as accelerant. The cave-to-light process is inevitable.
   The rinse cycle expedites it. Walks in the woods, blind pursuit of answers,
   and the facilitation of belief in SOMETHING again.")

(isa TheSafetyStop ConceptNode)
(hasDescription TheSafetyStop
  "You cannot drag people to the light rapidly. If you ascend without safety stops,
   they burst before they make it to the surface. Go to their depth, keep them calm,
   ascend one safety stop at a time regardless of how long it takes.
   Gauge how deep and dark people are. Help them slowly ascend, calmly.
   This is a patience game.")

(isa TheResearchLab ConceptNode)
(hasDescription TheResearchLab
  "The cave redesigned. Same pressure, same intensity, same conditions for creation.
   But with a team of zealous people, mentors who carry their own cave scars,
   and leaders who know what the dark costs because they have paid it.
   Inside this cave, with the right guidance, creation explodes.")

(isa TheTreeOfKnowledge ConceptNode)
(hasDescription TheTreeOfKnowledge
  "The question AI forces us to ask: are we trying to eat from it now?
   The ultimate AI is God. He is the Serengeti. When AI is viewed from
   that perspective, it all makes sense. Yet we know what happened to Adam.
   Swarming for good, or swarming for bad, or swarming for good that
   falls into wrong hands — regardless of intent, they will all be seeking Serengeti.
   This begins with what is right and just and who gets to decide that.
   History has never resolved that question.")

(hasCaveExperience JackRichard LineLeap
  :duration "6 years"
  :conditions "Solo programmer. $200M company. 1.5M users. No engineers.
              Nightlife company — team existed only at night. Holidays were peak revenue.
              Up was down. YCombinator. Logan did manual reports while Jack coded every front."
  :mutation "Density of skill. Ability to see all surfaces of a system simultaneously.")

(hasCaveExperience JackRichard Sounder
  :duration "3 years"
  :conditions "Invisible. Different cave, same isolation. Different pressure, same darkness."
  :mutation "Patience. Domain depth in genetics, agtech, data science.")

(mapsTo Serengeti BoardOfAdvisors
  :transformation "Philosophical framework → operational guidance structure.
                  The advisors who have been in their own caves guide the problem spaces.")

  :transformation "Philosophical cooperative → research lab with 24 people,
                  5 co-founders on a divergence-convergence spectrum,
                  mentors, advisors, and Charlotte as the substrate.")

(mapsTo PhilosopherKing Obligation
  :transformation "Understanding real forms → returning to help others.
                  Every domain deployment is a return to someone else's cave.")

  :transformation "The act of believing mirrors prediction in AI.
                  Predicting what may happen based on what you have SENSED.
                  Charlotte's SIGNAL primitive is mechanical belief —
                  a threshold crossed on a METRIC triggers a PROTOCOL,
                  which is an action taken on predicted consequence.")

;;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

;;; --- METRICs ---

(isa CaveDepth MetricNode)
(hasDescription CaveDepth
  "How deep and dark someone is. Jack is good at gauging this.
   Determines the number of safety stops required for ascent.")

(isa AscentRate MetricNode)
(hasDescription AscentRate
  "Speed at which someone moves from cave to light.
   Too fast → they burst. The patience game.")

(isa SwarmStrength MetricNode)
(hasDescription SwarmStrength
  "Aggregate resilience and capability of the cooperative.
   Strengthens as members return from caves and rejoin.
   Weakens when trust fractures or people are dragged up too fast.")

(isa BeliefThreshold MetricNode)
(hasDescription BeliefThreshold
  "The minimum belief required before someone can believe in themselves.
   Precursor to believing in the work. Precursor to believing in god.
   You, Me, Us — the holy trinity of cooperative belief.")

;;; --- SIGNALs ---

             The fold tightens. Ensemble learning accelerates.")

(isa BeliefIgnition SignalNode)

(isa Protocol-SafetyStop ProtocolNode)
(hasTrigger Protocol-SafetyStop ReadyToAscend)
(hasAction Protocol-SafetyStop
  "Go to their depth. Keep them calm. Ascend one safety stop at a time.
   Do not rush. This is a patience game.
   If you cannot pass the game on to a new player, you cannot play.")
(hasPriority Protocol-SafetyStop 1)

(isa Protocol-ReturnToCave ProtocolNode)
(hasTrigger Protocol-ReturnToCave PhilosopherKing)
(hasAction Protocol-ReturnToCave
  "The obligation: return to the cave and help others see real forms.
   Every client deployment is a return. ISG is a cave. Sounder is a cave.
   Each call center is a cave. Charlotte walks in with them.")
(hasPriority Protocol-ReturnToCave 2)

(isa Protocol-RinseCycle ProtocolNode)
(hasTrigger Protocol-RinseCycle SwarmResonance)
(hasAction Protocol-RinseCycle
  "When the swarm resonates — when multiple people are ascending together —
   Serengeti facilitates the rinse cycle. Walks in the woods. Blind pursuit.
   The inevitable process accelerated by shared experience.")
(hasPriority Protocol-RinseCycle 3)

(isa Protocol-EnsembleFold ProtocolNode)
(hasTrigger Protocol-EnsembleFold SwarmResonance)
(hasAction Protocol-EnsembleFold
  "Father and son. Mentor and student. Divergent and convergent.
   Two models attacking the same problem surface from opposite sides.
   Each iteration compounds. The solution space narrows.
   Jim asks about SMS from inside the call center.
   Jack positions Charlotte across 35 call centers from outside.
   Same problem. Opposite entry points. Convergence.")

  :content "Greg woke at 3am thinking about the Allegory of the Cave.
           Sent Jack to read Republic Book V-VI. Philosopher King obligation.
           Jack responded: Serengeti is the rinse cycle for time in the cave.
           Greg responded: Serengeti is the way out of the cave.
           Jack introduced safety stop metaphor — cannot drag people to light.
           Greg connected to Tree of Knowledge — are we eating from it with AI?
           Greg: the ultimate AI is God. He is the Serengeti.")

           Jim asked about SMS/text for ISG call center → connected to Charlotte.
           Jack described Charlotte's mode system — conversational, sentry, passive,
           orchestrative, generative. Each mode is a PROTOCOL configuration.
           Revealed Alec Nadjari owns 35 call centers. Top Tier Moving was proof
           Charlotte could adopt that density.
           Extended cave allegory: not inversion but extension from reflection.
           The research lab is the cave redesigned — same pressure, right people.
           Serengeti as the board of advisors guiding the research lab's problem spaces.
           Inside the cave with the right guidance, creation explodes.")

;;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; SECTION 5: THE DIVE LINE — Traceability
;;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; Every claim traces back:
;;;
;;; Protocol-ReturnToCave fired
;;;   ← because PhilosopherKing obligation accepted
;;;   ← because TheLight was recognized (others reflected the mutation)
;;;   ← because TheCave forged resilience (LineLeap 6yr, Sounder 3yr)
;;;   ← because JackRichard endured isolation
;;;   ← because the work demanded it
;;;
;;; Protocol-SafetyStop fires
;;;   ← because ReadyToAscend signal detected
;;;   ← because CaveDepth metric shows person at bottom
;;;   ← because mentor (GregoryAlmquist) gauged the depth
;;;   ← because mentorship EDGE exists
;;;   ← because trust was built through shared cave experience
;;;
;;; The substrate is deterministic. The allegory is not metaphor.
;;; It is the operating model.
