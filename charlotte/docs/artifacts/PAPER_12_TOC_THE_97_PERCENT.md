## Key Claims

- The adoption paradigm is structurally incapable of serving 97% of businesses
- The adoption tax is regressive — falls disproportionately on smallest businesses
- Non-adoption is rational, not backward
- Invisible infrastructure (absorption paradigm) delivers value without behavioral change
- 1% penetration of small business America = $6B ARR
- The correct measure of progress is how little technology people notice

## Charlotte Connection

This paper provides the innovation policy and socioeconomic foundation for the Charlotte substrate. While Papers 0–11 establish the technical architecture, Paper 12 establishes *why* that architecture must exist — not as academic exercise but as infrastructure for the 33.2 million businesses that technology has structurally excluded.
