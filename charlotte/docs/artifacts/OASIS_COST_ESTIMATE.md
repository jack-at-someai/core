# Serengeti Oasis — Phase 1 Cost Estimate

**Location:** Central Florida (Polk County corridor, Lakeland–Bartow–US 27)
**Size:** 100 acres
**Airport proximity:** 30–40 min to MCO (Orlando), 30–40 min to TPA (Tampa), adjacent to LAL (Lakeland Linder)
**Concept:** Research and operations layered in the same physical environment. Every operation runs as a containerized game instance on Charlotte. Co-location enables real-time analysis of latency and resonance between systems. All operations can be facilitated remotely.

## Why Polk County

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Land price** | $10,000–$15,000/acre for 100+ acre agricultural parcels — 40–60% cheaper than Osceola or Orange County |
| **Airport access** | 30–40 min to both MCO and TPA; Lakeland Linder (LAL) adjacent for private aviation |
| **Impact fees** | ~$13,400/residential unit vs. $30,000–$40,000+ in Osceola County |
| **Regulatory** | Florida eliminated DRI (Development of Regional Impact) review in 2015–2018 — no mandatory regional review for 100-acre mixed-use |
| **Permitting** | Florida statutory deadlines: 30 business days (<7,500 SF), 60 business days (>7,500 SF). Total entitlement: 12–24 months. |
| **Growth corridor** | I-4 logistics corridor, Publix HQ in Lakeland, active developer market, FPL grid-ready |

## Oasis Zones

The Oasis houses all four Charlotte validation domains plus the research infrastructure hub, layered on top of each other. Same substrate powering every zone — like Aptiv's smart city model where the same tech in the vehicles is the same tech powering the businesses around them.

### Phased Deployment Strategy

| Phase | Timeline | Cost Range | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Phase 0: Land + Entitlements** | Months 0–18 | $2–$3M | Secured land, approved PUD, infrastructure design |
| **Phase 1A: Infrastructure + Research Hub** | Months 12–24 | $18–$38M | Roads, utilities, fiber, solar, data center, ops center |
| **Phase 1B: First Operations** | Months 18–30 | $10–$18M | Livestock barns, coffee shop, co-working, first tenants |
| **Phase 1C: Full Activation** | Months 24–42 | $16–$30M | Industrial lab, artisan workshop, residential, full buildout |

**Phase 0 alone** — land + entitlements — is a **$2–$3M commitment** that secures the site and begins the 18-month permitting clock. This is the capital consolidation target.

## Revenue Model (Post-Activation)

| Revenue Stream | Annual Estimate | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Commercial tenant rent (cafe, co-working, retail) | $300K–$600K | Market-rate Polk County commercial |
| Residential rent (30 units) | $540K–$720K | $1,500–$2,000/mo per unit |
| Charlotte managed service contracts | $1.4M+ | Starting with industrial contract |
| Analytics + intelligence subscriptions | $200K–$500K | Cross-domain insights sold to industry |
| Visitor/demo fees (PE clients) | $100K–$200K | Facility tours, live demonstrations |
| Solar energy (net metering) | $50K–$100K | 2 MW system, Florida net metering |
| **Total annual revenue (Year 2–3)** | **$2.6M–$4.1M** | Before additional Charlotte contracts |

## Comparable Developments

| Project | Scale | Total Investment | Timeline | Key Lesson |
|---------|-------|------------------|----------|------------|
| **Babcock Ranch** | 18,000 acres, 19,500 homes | $2B over 20 years | 2006–ongoing | FPL built and owns the solar — partner, don't fund energy yourself |
| **Lake Nona** | 10,880 acres | $3B+ over 10 years | 2005–ongoing | Airport proximity was deliberate anchor; attracted institutions first |
| **Celebration** | 4,900 acres | $2.5B | 1991–1996 | Even Disney took 5 years from announcement to first residents |

**The Oasis is 100 acres, not 18,000.** These comparables show that even massive projects phase over decades. A 100-acre campus with $46–$89M Phase 1 is achievable with a single institutional investor or a small PE syndicate.

## The Latency and Resonance Argument

Having all four domains co-located on the same substrate in the same physical space enables analysis that remote deployment cannot:

- **Latency:** How fast does a signal in Zone B (equipment vibration anomaly) propagate to Zone E (operations center alert) to Zone C (service scheduling adjustment)? Measured in seconds at the Oasis. Unmeasurable across distributed clients.

- **Resonance:** When livestock breeding outcomes in Zone A improve, does co-working utilization in Zone C correlate? When a rare instrument sale closes in Zone D, does the operations center detect a pattern shift across all zones? These cross-domain resonance patterns are the proof that Charlotte is infrastructure for observable reality — not just a vertical tool.

- **The Game Engine:** Every zone is a containerized game instance. The coffee shop is a game. The pig herd is a game. The compressor test bench is a game. Charlotte is the engine that runs all of them on the same substrate. The Oasis is where you can watch all the games running simultaneously and measure how they interact.

*Estimated February 2026. Costs based on 2025–2026 central Florida construction data, Polk County land prices, and Florida regulatory framework. Contingency at 15% accounts for material cost variance and permitting delays.*
